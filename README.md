Gravity had been a serious subject of interest to two of the greatest giants of physics---Sir Issac Newton and Albert Einstein. Newton's inverse square law of gravity lived a long and prosperous life of two centuries. After that, Einstein revolutionized the human understanding of nature with his explanation of gravity. What Newton discovered proved to be a special case of Einstein's gravity.

Gravity does not represent Einstein's genius alone, but symbolizes  the beauty of the human mind as a whole. There were various mathematicians, physicists and philosophers whose ideas helped shape the present understanding of gravity. This project aims to compile the classic works that helped us understand gravity and reproduce them in more easily readable form using tools of Latex.
